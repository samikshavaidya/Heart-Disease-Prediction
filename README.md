# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This Dashboard is Created In Power BI Software. It is Built on Heart Disease Dataset Using Different Graphs, Cards and Slicers.

Heart disease prediction is One of the most important parameter. To study huge data or to analyze huge data we visualize the data with the help of visualization Tools. Before Visualization we need to clean Data Properly.  Data Cleaning is important. If your Data is not clean then itâ€™s difficult to analyze and plot graphs properly. Here is a two-page Dashboard made by me with the help of Power BI.

1. The heart disease dataset includes parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and presence of heart disease.
2. It is having Cards which shows total people, Max Age, Min Age, Average bp and St Depression
3. Slicers are of ECG result, Age and Sex
4. There are multiple graphs which shows comparison between various parameter and with the help of this comparison we can find out that because of which all parameter the patient is suffering from heart diseases along with the age
This Is the Basic Data Visualization from My Side.
